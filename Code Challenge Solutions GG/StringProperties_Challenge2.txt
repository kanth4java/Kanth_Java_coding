Describe properties of Java String.



String:Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters

Some properties of String :

Immutable:

The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. 
If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters, then you should use String Buffer & String Builder Classes.

 Java String Concatenation

+ is a special operator when it comes to java String. It helps to concatenate two String.

Example:
"Hello," + " world" + "!"


Java String Connversion


ToString:toString() is a method that belongs to Object class.
Every wrapper classes implements toString() method which returns a String object of the passed primitive.

Creating Format Strings:

You have printf() and format() methods to print output with formatted numbers. 
The String class has an equivalent class method, format(), that returns a String object rather than a PrintStream object.

Exampe:
String fs;
fs = String.format("The value of the float " +
                   "variable is %f, while " +
                   "the value of the " + 
                   "integer variable is %d, " +
                   " and the string is %s",
                   floatVar, intVar, stringVar);
System.out.println(fs);


String Length:

Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods.
One accessor method that you can use with strings is the length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object.
